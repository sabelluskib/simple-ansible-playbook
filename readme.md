This small example allows you to demonstrate working with ansible:

# How to replicate

1. Install ansible, for example in debian-base distributions: apt-get install ansible
2. Configure the remote machines you are looking for: create users, set up ssh key connections. 3. 
3. edit the inventory.ini file for your machines
4. Replace the copy paths you are looking for in playbook.yml
